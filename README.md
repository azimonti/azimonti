## About Me

I am an Aerospace Engineer with over 25 years of experience in computer programming. My expertise spans across various fields, including mathematics, physics, and engineering.

Throughout my career, I have specialized in numerical simulation, beginning with **Fortran** and **C++**, which I still actively use and master. Over the years, I have adapted to newer tools, and **Python** has become my go-to language for data analysis and visualization. However, the core computations in my projects are still powered by the efficiency and precision of C++ and Fortran.

## Core Competencies

- **Numerical Simulation:** Extensive experience in developing and implementing numerical models for complex systems, particularly in aerospace applications. Strong ability to translate physical problems into computational frameworks.

- **Programming Languages:** Deep expertise in Fortran and C++, where I manage performance-critical computations. Additionally, I use Python for data analysis and visualization, combining modern tools with traditional high-performance languages.

- **Mathematics and Physics:** Advanced knowledge in applied mathematics and physics, essential for designing accurate models and simulations.

- **Data Analysis and Visualization:** Leveraging Python's extensive libraries (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib) to efficiently process and visualize large datasets, facilitating insights into the results of simulations.

## Additional Skills

I have also refined my skills in web design and full stack development, starting with Ruby over 10 years ago before shifting my focus to Node.js. This journey has equipped me with a deep understanding of both front-end and back-end technologies, including the intricacies of APIs, enabling me to create cohesive, efficient web applications that deliver seamless user experiences.

I am proficient in **Node.js** and **JavaScript**, allowing me to develop scalable and performant back-end systems while ensuring responsive, dynamic front-end designs.

## Areas of Interest and Research

- **Quantum Mechanics and Classical Mechanics Simulations:** Focus on creating simulations that model physical and engineering phenomena in quantum mechanics, classical mechanics, statics, and astrodynamics. These simulations are designed to provide insight into complex physical systems and engineering applications.

- **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning:** Strong interest in exploring advanced AI techniques, focusing on cutting-edge algorithms and neural network architectures. My work aims to push the boundaries of AI research and development.

- **Practical Applications of AI:** Dedicated to applying AI technologies to real-world challenges, with a particular emphasis on automation, data analysis, and the development of intelligent systems. These systems not only replicate human decision-making but also offer creative and efficient solutions to complex scenarios.
